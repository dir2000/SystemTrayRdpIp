This simple Java program intends to show an IP-address of a machine, that remote connects to current computer, using RDP-protocol. After start the program implicitly runs "netstat" command in separate thread. This command outputs a list of current network connections. The program searches in the list a row with local port 3389, that is default remote desktop protocol port. If such a row is present, the program extracts remote IP-address or remote computer name and resolves IP-address from the name. The program shows a blue round icon in the System tray. Left click to show IP-address, right click to show popup menu with one "Exit" item.
